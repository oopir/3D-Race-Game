# 3D-Race-Game
The game was developed in C# (using the Microsoft XNA Framework) as a way to practice OOP.<br/>
- Tracks & scenery are generated from sketches drawn in mspaint (see AllContentFiles/roads/).
- The required physics are implemented from scratch.

## Installation
(1) Download the contents of the `publish` folder.<br/>
(2) Run the msi file to install the XNA Framework (or download from the internet).<br/>
(3) Run the `setup.exe` file.
